# Cloud Foundry CLI written in Go [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/cli.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/cli)

## Usage tips

To enable tab-completion in Bash, you can either:

* Enable tab-completion only for your current shell with `eval "$(cf bash-autocomplete)"`
* Enable it for all users by putting the script in a central sourced location, e.g. `cf bash-autocomplete > /etc/bash_completion.d/cf`

## Background

Project to rewrite the Cloud Foundry CLI tool using Go. This project should currently be considered alpha quality
software and should not be used in production environments. If you need something more stable, please check
out the [RubyGem](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf).

## Building
1. Run `./bin/build`
1. The binary will be built into the out directory.

## Development

NOTE: Currently only development on OSX 10.8 is supported

1. Install Go `brew install go --cross-compile-common`
1. Fork and clone.
1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
1. Write a test.
1. Run `bin/test` and watch test fail.
1. Make test pass.
1. Submit a pull request.

### Adding a new command

1. Add your implementation of a Command to the [commands folder](src/cf/commands/). (Use other commands as reference, beginning with test files.)
1. Add a new method to [Factory](src/cf/commands/factory.go) to create your command.
1. In [src/cf/app/app.go](src/cf/app/app.go), create an entry in the assignment to `app.Commands` and make the appropriate call to the new method you added in the previous step.

## Releasing

1. Run `bin/build-all`. This will create tgz files in the release folder.
