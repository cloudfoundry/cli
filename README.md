***Cloud Foundry CLI*** is the official command line client for [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org).
Latest help of each command is [here](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org) (or run `cf help`);
Further documentation is at the [docs page for the
CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli).

If you have any questions, ask away on the #cli channel in [our Slack
community](http://slack.cloudfoundry.org/) and the
[cf-dev](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/)
mailing list, or [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/new).  You can follow our development progress
on [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/892938).

## Getting Started

Download and install the cf CLI from the [Downloads Section](#downloads).

Once installed, you can log in and push an app.

![Example](.github/cf_example.gif)

Check out our [community contributed CLI plugins](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org) to further enhance your CLI experience.

## Downloads

### Installing using a package manager

**Mac OS X** (using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) via the [cloudfoundry tap](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/homebrew-tap)):

```sh
brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli
```

**Debian** and **Ubuntu** based Linux distributions:

```sh
# ...first add the Cloud Foundry Foundation public key and package repository to your system
wget -q -O - https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian/cli.cloudfoundry.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfoundry-cli.list
# ...then, update your local package index, then finally install the cf CLI
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cf-cli
```

**Enterprise Linux** and **Fedora** systems (RHEL6/CentOS6 and up):
```sh
# ...first configure the Cloud Foundry Foundation package repository
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudfoundry-cli.repo https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/fedora/cloudfoundry-cli.repo
# ...then, install the cf CLI (which will also download and add the public key to your system)
sudo yum install cf-cli
```

**Download examples** with curl for Mac OS X and Linux binaries
```sh
# ...download & extract Mac OS X binary
curl -L "https://cli.run.pivotal.io/stable?release=macosx64-binary&source=github" | tar -zx
# ...or Linux 64-bit binary
curl -L "https://cli.run.pivotal.io/stable?release=linux64-binary&source=github" | tar -zx
# ...move it to /usr/local/bin or a location you know is in your $PATH
mv cf /usr/local/bin
# ...copy tab completion file on Ubuntu (takes affect after re-opening your shell)
sudo curl -o /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/cf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/cli/master/ci/installers/completion/cf
# ...and to confirm your cf CLI version
cf --version
```

#### Edge binaries
Edge binaries are *not intended for wider use*; they're for developers to test new features and fixes as they are 'pushed' and passed through the CI.
Follow these download links for [Mac OS X 64 bit](https://cli.run.pivotal.io/edge?arch=macosx64&source=github), [Windows 64 bit](https://cli.run.pivotal.io/edge?arch=windows64&source=github) and [Linux 64 bit](https://cli.run.pivotal.io/edge?arch=linux64&source=github).

## Known Issues

* In Cygwin and Git Bash on Windows, interactive password prompts (in `cf login`) do not work (see [issue #171](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/171)). Please use alternative commands (`cf api` and `cf auth` to `cf login`) to work around this.
* API tracing to terminal (using `CF_TRACE=true`, `-v` option or `cf config --trace`) doesn't work well with some CLI plugin commands. Trace to file works fine. On Linux, `CF_TRACE=/dev/stdout` works too. See e.g. [this Diego-Enabler plugin issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/Diego-Enabler/issues/6).
* .cfignore used in `cf push` must be in UTF8 encoding for CLI to interpret correctly.
* On Linux, when encountering message "bash: .cf: No such file or directory", ensure that you're using the correct binary or installer for your architecture. See http://askubuntu.com/questions/133389/no-such-file-or-directory-but-the-file-exists

## Filing Issues & Feature Requests

First, update to the [latest cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases)
and try the command again.

If the error remains or feature still missing, check the [open issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues) and if not already raised please file a new issue with the requested details.

## Plugin Development
