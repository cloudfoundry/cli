There are now two supported versions of the cf CLI:
1. The v7 cf CLI is backed by the [v3 CC API](http://v3-apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/version/3.85.0/) (with the exception of plugins which will be migrated in the next major release). See [our v7 documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/v7.html) for more information.
1. The v6 cf CLI is backed by the [v2 CC API](https://apidocs.cloudfoundry.org/13.5.0/) See [our v6 documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli) for more information.


## The initial GA of the v7 cf CLI is Opt-In  
- You can pull down the GA release of the v7 cf CLI and/or the latest v6 cf CLI via our supported package managers using the same processes that were in place prior to the v7 GA (no changes are required initially)
- If you've been pulling down the v7 CF CLI beta previously, you will notice the name of the v7 binary has changed from `cf7` to `cf`
- See our [Version Switching](#version-switching) section for instructions on how to support workflows which require switching back and forth between v7 and v6

**A Note About Support**:</br>
Now that the v7 cf CLI is GA, all new features, enhancements, and fixes will be made on the v7 line.</br>
The v7 CLI's _minimum supported version_ of the CC API is `v3.85.0` (published in [CAPI release v1.95.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.95.0)).</br>
The v7 CLI's _minimum supported version_ of the CF-Deployment is [`v13.5.0`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v13.5.0).

Going forward, the v6 CLI will _only_ be updated to resolve the most severe defects and/or security issues.
At some point in the future, the v2 CC API endpoint will be deprecated by CAPI (see the [v2 CC API deprecation plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KFZogeeexOqFf13oKHloe2QAorLh9OqwQHp8JvBl9lY/edit?usp=sharing)) and the v6 CLI will be incompatible CAPI once a `capi-release` that deprecates the v2 endpoint has been published.
Until the v2 CC API is deprecated, you can expect the v6 CLI to be fully functional, however, the CLI team's CI/CD resources are now focused on the v7 CLI so the v6 CLIs official **_maximum supported version_** of the CC APIs are now capped at `v2.149.0` and `v3.84.0` (published in [CAPI release v1.94.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.94.0)), and the V6 CLIs official **_maximum supported version_** of the CF-Deployment is now capped at [`v13.4.0`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v13.4.0).

The v7 CLI's _minimum supported version_ of the CC APIs are `v2.128.0` and `v3.63.0` (published in [CAPI release v1.74.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.74.0)).</br> 
The v6 CLI's _minimum supported version_ of the CF-Deployment is [`v7.0.0`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v7.0.0). If you are on an older version of CF Deployment, we recommend you upgrade to CF-Deployment v7.0.0+.

If you have any questions, ask away on the #cli channel in [our Slack
community](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/) and the
[cf-dev](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/archives/list/cf-dev@lists.cloudfoundry.org/)
mailing list, or [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/new).  You can follow our development progress
on [Core CF CLI Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/892938).

## Getting Started

Download and install the cf CLI from the [Downloads Section](#downloads) for either the [v7 cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/blob/master/README.md#downloading-the-latest-v7-cf-cli) or the [v6 cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/blob/master/README.md#downloading-the-latest-v6-cf-cli).

Once installed, you can log in and push an app.

**Need to switch back and forth between CLI versions?**
See the [Version Switching](#version-switching) section for instructions.

![Example](.github/cf_example.gif)

Check out our [community contributed CLI plugins](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org) to further enhance your CLI experience.

## Downloads

It is recommended to download installers from the published URLs or using one of the documented package managers (APT/deb/homebrew repos).  Published URLs may redirect requests to URLs that may change over time, so may installer filenames change over time.

### Downloading the latest CF CLI
As of 6/29/2020, the instructions in this section will result in pulling the latest v6 cf CLI however at some point in the near future, we'll make updates to point to the v7 line instead.
#### Installing using a package manager

**Mac OS X** and **Linux** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via the [cloudfoundry tap](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/homebrew-tap):

```sh
brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli
```

**Note:** `cf` tab completion requires `bash-completion` to be installed properly in order to work.

**Debian** and **Ubuntu** based Linux distributions:

```sh
# ...first add the Cloud Foundry Foundation public key and package repository to your system
wget -q -O - https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian/cli.cloudfoundry.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfoundry-cli.list
# ...then, update your local package index, then finally install the cf CLI
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cf-cli
```

**Enterprise Linux** and **Fedora** systems (RHEL6/CentOS6 and up):
```sh
# ...first configure the Cloud Foundry Foundation package repository
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudfoundry-cli.repo https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/fedora/cloudfoundry-cli.repo
# ...then, install the cf CLI (which will also download and add the public key to your system)
sudo yum install cf-cli
```

### Downloading the latest V7 CF CLI

**Important Note**: The v7 CF CLI is now GA and the binary has been renamed from `cf7` to `cf`. If you're already using the v7 CLI in parallel to the v6 CLI, you may need to change your workflow to accomodate the binary name change. See the [Version Switching](#version-switching) section for instructions. For more information and general status on the v7 CLI, please check [releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).

#### Compatibility
The v7 CLI's minimum supported version of the CC API is `v3.85.0` (published in [CAPI release v1.95.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.95.0)).
See the [releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) page for the minimum CAPI versions required for each V7 release.

##### Edge binaries
Edge binaries are *not intended for wider use*; they're for developers to test new features and fixes as they are 'pushed' and passed through the CI.

### Version Switching
The GA'd v7 cf CLI binary is named `cf` whereas all the beta release v7 binaries were named `cf7`.
Workflows that require switching between the v7 and v6 CLIs can be scripted to accomodate utilizing binaries of the same name on a single computer.

Below you'll find instructions for each of the package managers we support.

#### Switching CLI versions Using Brew
- Assuming you've installed both the v6 and v7 CLIs as follows...
  - `brew install cf-cli@7`
  - `brew install cf-cli@6`
- Switch from v6 to v7:
  - `brew unlink cf-cli@6 && brew unlink cf-cli@7 && brew link cf-cli@7 && cf version`
- Switch from v7 to v6:
  - `brew unlink cf-cli@7 && brew unlink cf-cli@6 && brew link cf-cli@6 && cf version`



#### Switching CLI versions Using Yum or Apt
We're working on a robust soluiton that will faciliate more seamless switching via these package managers, but for now you must uninstall one version of the CLI and install the other version of the CLI to switch between them.
- Currently on v6, want to switch to v7:
  - yum: `sudo yum remove cf-cli && sudo yum install cf7-cli && cf version`
  - apt: `sudo apt-get remove cf-cli && sudo apt-get install cf7-cli && cf version`
- Currently on v7, want to switch to v6:
  - yum: `sudo yum remove cf7-cli && sudo yum install cf-cli && cf version`
  - apt: `sudo apt-get remove cf7-cli && sudo apt-get install cf-cli && cf version`

#### Switching CLI Versions Pulled via GitHub or CLAW
The following is a simple approach:
- Download the v6 and v7 binaries into separate directories
- Write a scipt that updates your `PATH` so it points to the binary for the version of the CLI you need to run:
  - `export PATH=/path/to/your/v6-or-v7/binary/:$PATH`

## Known Issues

* On Windows in Cygwin and Git Bash, interactive password prompts (in `cf login`) do not hide the password properly from stdout ([issue #1835](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/1835)). Please use an alternative command (non-interactive authentication `cf auth` instead of `cf login`) to work around this. Or, use the Windows `cmd` command line.
* On Windows, `cf ssh` may not display correctly if the `TERM` is not set. We've found that setting `TERM` to `msys` fixes some of these issues.
* On Windows, `cf ssh` will hang when run from the MINGW32 or MINGW64 shell. A workaround is to use PowerShell instead.
* CF CLI/GoLang do not use OpenSSL. Custom/Self Signed Certificates need to be [installed in specific locations](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/self-signed.html) in order to `login`/`auth` without `--skip-ssl-validation`.
* API tracing to terminal (using `CF_TRACE=true`, `-v` option or `cf config --trace`) doesn't work well with some CLI plugin commands. Trace to file works fine. On Linux, `CF_TRACE=/dev/stdout` works too. See [this Diego-Enabler plugin issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-attic/Diego-Enabler/issues/6) for more information.
* .cfignore used in `cf push` must be in UTF-8 encoding for CLI to interpret correctly. ([issue #281](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/281#issuecomment-65315518))
* On Linux, when encountering message "bash: .cf: No such file or directory", ensure that you're using the [correct binary or installer for your architecture](https://askubuntu.com/questions/133389/no-such-file-or-directory-but-the-file-exists).

## Filing Issues & Feature Requests

First, update to the [latest cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases)
and try the command again.

If the error remains or feature still missing, check the [open issues](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues) and if not already raised please file a new issue with the requested details.

## Plugin Development

The CF CLI supports external code execution via the plugins API. For more
information follow:

* [The CF CLI plugin development guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/tree/master/plugin/plugin_examples)
* [The official plugins repository](https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/)

When importing the plugin code use `import "code.cloudfoundry.org/cli/plugin"`.
Older plugins that import `github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/plugin` will still work
as long they vendor the plugins directory.
