### Downloading the latest V7 CF CLI

**Important Note**: The v7 CF CLI is now GA and the binary has been renamed from `cf7` to `cf`. If you're already using the v7 CLI in parallel to the v6 CLI, you may need to change your workflow to accomodate the binary name change. See the [Version Switching](#version-switching) section for instructions. For more information and general status on the v7 CLI, please check [releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases).

#### Compatibility
The v7 CLI's minimum supported version of the CC API is `v3.85.0` (published in [CAPI release v1.95.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.95.0)).
See the [releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) page for the minimum CAPI versions required for each V7 release.


#### Installing using a package manager

**Mac OS X** and **Linux** using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via the [cloudfoundry tap](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/homebrew-tap):

```sh
brew install cloudfoundry/tap/cf-cli@7
```

**Note:** `cf` tab completion requires `bash-completion` to be installed properly in order to work.

**Debian** and **Ubuntu** based Linux distributions:

```sh
# ...first add the Cloud Foundry Foundation public key and package repository to your system
wget -q -O - https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian/cli.cloudfoundry.org.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cloudfoundry-cli.list
# ...then, update your local package index, then finally install the cf CLI
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cf7-cli
```

**Enterprise Linux** and **Fedora** systems (RHEL6/CentOS6 and up):
```sh
# ...first configure the Cloud Foundry Foundation package repository
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/cloudfoundry-cli.repo https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/fedora/cloudfoundry-cli.repo
# ...then, install the cf CLI (which will also download and add the public key to your system)
sudo yum install cf7-cli
```
